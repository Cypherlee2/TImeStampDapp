# Document Timestamp & Verification

The Document Timestamp & Verification DApp is a secure and innovative solution powered by storing and retrieving unique document hashes, leveraging the robust SHA-256 hash function to manage and protect these hashes within the DApp. This process ensures the integrity and authenticity of documents. Thereafter, the DApp timestamps the document, creating a permanent record of its existence. Subsequently, users can verify the document's authenticity using the corresponding hash, which helps to definitively determine if the document was previously timestamped and provides a clear record of when the document was first recorded, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness.
